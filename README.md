# AWFCocoaUtils

Cocoa utility classes by Adam Fox. This is a collection of helper classes and categories that are derived from knowledge gained through both professional and independent research and coding projects.

While I originally learned of some of the techniques used here while coding professionally, all of the code is either written from scratch or derived from open source examples.  None of the code contains any proprietary information.  If you are concerned that there could be an intellectual property issue with any of the code here, please contact me and I will provide references to widely available public sources.
